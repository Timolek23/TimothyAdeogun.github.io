    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I’m a Computer Science student at Bowen University with a strong interest in building
      practical digital solutions. I enjoy turning real-life problems into structured systems,
      whether through code, design, or strategy.

    <h2>Projects & Interests</h2>
    <p>
      I’ve worked on and designed ideas such as a library management system, health tracking apps,
      crypto wallet concepts, and transport solutions for student environments.
    </p>
    <p>
      I focus more on *usefulness* than hype — if it solves a real problem, it matters.

  <section class="vision">
    <h2>Vision & Strategy</h2>
    <p>
      My approach is simple: understand the problem deeply, design a clear solution,
      then build step by step. I believe good systems don’t need noise — they need clarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long term, I aim to combine technology, design, and business to create platforms
      that improve everyday experiences.
